# Psychic Game
## HTML, CSS, Javascript

In the Psychic Game the player tries to guess which letter the computer has chosen. You have 10 guesses, which will show up as you press each key. The game will alert you when have guessed correctly (A Winner!), and when you have exhausted your turns (You Lost!). The game will keep track of your wins and losses as well as automacially reset after a game has come to a decision. Good Luck!
